Project Architecture & Pipeline
1. High-Level Architecture
+--------------------------------------------------------+
|                        GUI (PyQt)                      |
|  - Input Field (Command / Natural Language)             |
|  - Output Console (Results / Errors / Confirmations)    |

              Command / NL Input | Feedback

+--------------------------------------------------------+
|                 Command Engine Layer                   |
|                                                        |
|  1. Input Pre-Processor                                |
|     - Detect mode (Direct Command / Natural Language)   |
|     - Parse and normalize input                        |
|                                                        |
|  2. Safety Net & Command Validator                     |
|     - Identify risky commands (rm, mv, overwrite)      |
|     - Trigger confirmation prompts (sudo-like)         |
|     - Validate paths, destinations, permissions        |
|                                                        |
|  3. Command Mapper                                     |
|     - NL → System Command (via rule-based + NLP model) |
|     - Alias support ("list files" → `ls`)              |
|                                                        |
|  4. Execution Manager                                  |
|     - Sends safe/validated commands to system shell    |
|     - Handles process mgmt (start, stop, kill, etc.)   |

+--------------------------------------------------------+
|                  System Interaction Layer              |
|  - OS Shell (Linux/Mac: bash/zsh, Windows: cmd/powershell) |
|  - File System APIs                                     |
|  - Process Control APIs                                 |
|  - Networking Utilities                                 |

+--------------------------------------------------------+
|                Response Handling & Output              |
|  - Collect stdout / stderr                              |
|  - Apply formatting, syntax highlighting               |
|  - Send back to GUI                                    |

2. Pipeline (Step-by-Step Flow)

User Input (GUI)

User types either:

A direct system command (ls -l)

A natural language command (show me all files here)

Pre-Processing

Detect if input is natural language or direct shell command.

Normalize input (strip spaces, handle case, etc.).

Command Validation (Safety Net)

If the command is destructive (e.g., rm file.txt, mv important.txt):

Prompt user for confirmation (Are you sure? Y/N).

Validate the target path exists and destination is given.

Prevent ambiguous operations (rm with no args → blocked).

Command Mapping (if NL)

Convert natural language → actual system command.

Example:

“make a folder called test” → mkdir test

“delete file report.txt” → rm report.txt (with safety confirmation).

Execution Manager

Pass the validated + safe command to OS shell.

Manage processes (PID tracking, killing, etc.).

Catch execution errors.

System Interaction

File operations → File system API.

Process management → OS process API.

Networking → Native system utilities.

Response Handling

Collect system output (stdout, stderr).

Apply formatting → highlight paths, errors in red, etc.

Show results in PyQt console.

Feedback Loop

If command was rejected/ambiguous → send back an error/clarification request.

If successful → output results to user.

3. Safety & Clarity Enforcement

Confirmation Layer → For delete, move, overwrite, and creation.

Path Validation → Prevents “rm /” or similar dangerous ops.

Clear Prompts → When user says “move file”, system asks: “Move to which directory?”.

NL Disambiguation → If multiple interpretations, system asks follow-up.
