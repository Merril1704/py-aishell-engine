1. GUI Layer (PyQt)
Goal: Build a user-friendly interface for input and output.

Stage 1: Create main window with input field and output console.
Stage 2: Connect input field to trigger command processing.
Stage 3: Display results, errors, and confirmation prompts in the output console.
2. Command Engine Layer
Goal: Process user input, map natural language to system commands, and enforce safety.

Stage 1: Input Pre-Processor
Detect if input is a direct command or natural language.
Normalize and parse input.
Stage 2: Safety Net & Validator
Identify risky commands (delete, move, overwrite).
Prompt for confirmation and validate paths.
Stage 3: Command Mapper
Translate natural language to shell/system commands.
Support aliases and macros.
3. Execution Manager
Goal: Safely execute validated commands and manage processes.

Stage 1: Send commands to system shell.
Stage 2: Handle process management (start, stop, kill).
Stage 3: Catch and handle execution errors.
4. System Interaction Layer
Goal: Interface with OS for file, process, and network operations.

Stage 1: Implement file system operations (list, create, delete, move).
Stage 2: Implement process management.
Stage 3: Implement networking utilities.
5. Response Handling & Output
Goal: Format and display results to the user.

Stage 1: Collect stdout/stderr from executed commands.
Stage 2: Apply formatting (syntax highlighting, error coloring).
Stage 3: Send results back to GUI.
6. Safety & Clarity Enforcement
Goal: Prevent accidental destructive actions and clarify ambiguous requests.

Stage 1: Confirmation prompts for risky actions.
Stage 2: Path validation and protected commands.
Stage 3: Interactive disambiguation for vague requests.


Recommended Flow to Complete the Project
Start with the GUI: Make sure users can enter commands and see output.
Build the Command Engine: Process input, validate, and map commands.
Implement Execution Manager: Safely run commands and manage processes.
Develop System Interaction: Add file, process, and network operations.
Integrate Response Handling: Format and display results in the GUI.
Add Safety Features: Confirmation dialogs, path validation, and clarity prompts.
Test End-to-End: Try various commands, confirm safety nets, and refine UX.
Document & Polish: Update README, add usage examples, and improve UI/UX.
