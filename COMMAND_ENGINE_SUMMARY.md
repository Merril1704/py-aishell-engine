# Command Engine Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Command Engine has been successfully implemented according to your pipeline specification with the following 4-stage architecture:

### 1. Input Pre-Processor (`engine/preprocessor.py`)
- **Mode Detection**: Automatically detects whether input is a direct command or natural language
- **Normalization**: Cleans and processes input text
- **Pattern Recognition**: Uses regex patterns to identify command structures vs. natural language

### 2. Safety Net & Command Validator (`engine/safety.py`)
- **Risk Assessment**: Categorizes commands as safe, risky, or critical
- **Dangerous Command Blocking**: Blocks extremely dangerous operations (e.g., `rm -rf /`)
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Generates appropriate warnings for risky operations
- **Protected Path Validation**: Prevents operations on system-critical directories

### 3. Command Mapper (`engine/mapper.py`)
- **Natural Language Processing**: Maps common phrases to system commands
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Handles both Windows and Unix/Linux commands
- **Contextual Understanding**: Extracts parameters from natural language (filenames, paths, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supports file operations, process management, networking, and system info

### 4. Execution Manager (`engine/executor.py`)
- **Process Management**: Handles background processes, process termination, and monitoring
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents hanging commands with 30-second timeout
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and error reporting
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

## Key Features

### Natural Language Support
- "list files" → `dir` (Windows) / `ls -la` (Unix)
- "create a folder called test" → `mkdir test`
- "show me the current directory" → `dir` (Windows) / `ls -la` (Unix)
- "delete file important.txt" → Safety prompt before execution

### Safety Features
- **Critical Command Blocking**: Commands like `rm -rf /` are completely blocked
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Risky operations require user confirmation
- **Path Protection**: System directories are protected from accidental deletion
- **Wildcard Detection**: Special handling for dangerous wildcard operations

### Process Management
- **Background Processes**: Start processes with `bg command`
- **Process Termination**: Kill processes by PID or name
- **Process Monitoring**: List and monitor running processes

### Testing Results
All test cases passed successfully:
- ✅ Natural language commands mapped correctly
- ✅ Direct commands executed properly
- ✅ Safety checks blocked dangerous operations
- ✅ Confirmation prompts generated for risky commands
- ✅ Process management functions working

## Usage Example

```python
from engine import CommandEngine

# Initialize the engine
engine = CommandEngine()

# Process user input
success, output, error = engine.process_input("list files in this directory")

if success:
    print("Command output:", output)
else:
    print("Error or confirmation needed:", error)

# Cleanup when done
engine.cleanup()
```

## Next Steps
The Command Engine is ready for integration with your GUI layer. The next recommended steps are:

1. **GUI Integration**: Connect the CommandEngine to your PyQt interface
2. **Confirmation Dialog**: Implement GUI dialogs for safety confirmations
3. **Output Formatting**: Add syntax highlighting and formatting to output
4. **Extended NLP**: Consider integrating more advanced NLP models for better natural language understanding
5. **User Preferences**: Add customizable safety levels and command aliases

## Dependencies
- `psutil>=5.9.0` (for process management)
- Standard Python libraries: `subprocess`, `platform`, `re`, `os`
